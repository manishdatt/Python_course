# Introduction to Python and Biopython


This tutorial would guide you to get started with coding in Python. We'll start with basic programming concepts related to working with text data. This would be followed by an introduction to the Biopython library that is useful for working with biological data. This tutorial is structured by topics that we'll be covering; the navigation bar on the left has the list of topics. Below is an outline for all the sections.


[Variables and Operators](Variables_Operators.ipynb): Introduction to the concept and properties of variables and different operators used in programming.


[Strings](Strings.ipynb): Introduction to the String class in Python and different functions available for working with strings.

[Introduction to Biopython](BioPython_Intro.ipynb): Introduction to the sequence object for working with alignments and running BLAST search.


Throughout the tutorial, the python code is shown as a code block with grey background, e.g.

```
print("Hello World!")
```

:::{note}
When you hover the mouse pointer over a code cell, there will be an option to copy the contents of that cell.
